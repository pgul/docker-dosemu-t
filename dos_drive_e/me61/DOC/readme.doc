Multi-Edit Version 6.10

Hi there!  This file contains important notes, additions and changes to
the printed manual, known bugs, and information about converting
Version 5 macros to Version 6.

NOTE:  All additional .DOC files are stored in the subdirectory DOC\.


CONVERTING YOUR SETUP FROM 5.0 or 6.0 TO 6.1
	You must first install version 6.1 in a DIFFERENT directory
	than the previous version.  To run the 6.1 conversion macro,
	you must have installed it from the distribution disks, and
	then (after you have exited from Installation and Setup) run
	the macro CONV_610.

TECH SUPPORT
	The preferred way to report bugs and get tech support is via
	our Compuserve Forum section 11 in PCVENE (GO CYBERNET).

	If you do not have access to a modem, then please feel free to
	call us here at 602-968-1945, and ask for Tech-Support.

ALL THE NEW 6.1 STUFF
	There is an extensive list of new features and changes in
	NEW61.DOC.

THE NEW TEMPLATE LANGUAGE
	Much of our language specific template expansion is now done in
	a special "template language" that allows easy user changes.
	This "language" is explained in detail in TEMPLATE.DOC.

CONFIGURING C INDENT AND TEMPLATE STYLES
	You can modify the C indenting and template expansion to a
	couple of common styles very quickly by changing a couple of
	#defines near the top of C.S (right after the header that
	describes what macros are in the file).   The #defines are
	commented.

VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM SUPPORT (Professional version only)
	The VCS macro provides support for Burton Systems TLIB,
	Intersolve's PVCS, Mortice Kern Systems's RCS (also generic
	UNIX RCS) and Solution Systems' Sourcerer's Apprentice.  The
	main VCS macro is called "VCS" and can be assigned to a key,
	run from the USER MENU or run from the RUN MACRO prompt.  It is
	installed from the MACRO SOURCE disk.

	To invoke VCS support after installing from the MACRO SOURCE
	disk run the macro VCS, and select INSTALLATION AND
	SETUP from the menu that pops up.  You'll be prompted for the
	Version Control System you want, and your STARTUP files will be
	automatically modified.

	All of the documentation for the VCS support is in the online
	help, so simply hit <F1> from the VCS menu to get started.

	NOTE:  VCS has already been added to your User menu

BRIEF KEYMAP
	There is some additional info on the new BRIEF emulation macro
	in BRIEF.DOC.

CLIPPER USERS
	We have recently improved the DBASE language support to include
	support for the Clipper version 5 dialect.  This includes
	support for "While" instead of "DO While", "End" instead of
	"Endxx", and C style comments "/* */" and "//".  To enable
	these capabilities, you must place the following line in the
	STARTUP.S file:

		Set_Global_Int('!DBASE_DIALECT',1);

	Then you must recompile STARTUP.S.  See the manual for
	details on compiling macros.

MICROSOFT WINDOWS 3.0, OS/2, DESQview
	Multi-Edit works best as a FULL-SCREEN application under
	WINDOWS.  There is a 'PIF' file for use in WINDOWS in the
	Multi-Edit subdirectory (also included is the file ME.ICO,
	which is a Multi-Edit ICON for Windows 3.0).  Multi-Edit also
	works fine in the DOS compatibility box of OS/2 and under
	DESQview.

	For DESQview, set the "Writes directly to screen" and
	"Virtualize Text/Graphics" options to "N" (this is done inside
	DESQview).  The Multi-Edit "/D" command line option must NOT be
	used in this case (if /D is used, both questions should be set
	to "Y").  Also, be sure to NOT set the protection level (in the
	Advanced Setup Screen of DESQview) greater than 1.

	NOTE:  You should allocate at least 350K (preferably 400K) of
	RAM to Multi-Edit when running from WINDOWS or DESQview.

PC-KWIK
	There may be an incompatibility between this caching program and
	Multi-Edit's disk swapping management routines.  Report is that
	their version 1.58 works fine with Multi-Edit.  Some versions
	may require the use of the L- switch in order to work properly.
	Note that some versions of PC-KWIK are also incompatible with
	WINDOW's HIMEM.SYS program.

COREFAST
	The CFTIME scheduler used with this CORE backup utility is not
	compatible with Multi-Edit.

DOS PRINT & MODE
	These DOS commands affect the current state of memory, and like
	all "TSR's", must NOT be run for the first time when shelled out
	of Multi-Edit.  They must be "loaded" before invoking
	Multi-Edit, and then can be run from within the editor.

USER MENU
	Multi-Edit is shipped with a number of macros already on the
	User Menu.  They may be deleted and/or additional programs
	added.

	NoteBook:  Our cool note organizer.

	Convert keystroke macro to macro source code:
		This macro lets you convert keystroke macros to KEY_IN
		statements in the macro language.  See the MACRO
		LANGUAGE REFERENCE GUIDE for detailed information on
		KEY_IN.

	List unassigned keys in EDIT mode:
		This is real handy when you want to assign keys for
		your own Keystroke or other macros.  Tells what keys
		are available.

	Phone - Address list:
		Check out the little phone/address directory we threw
		in.

	Version Control Support:
		See the notations on VCS above.


KEYSTROKE MACROS
	MULTI-EDIT IS SHIPPED WITH TWO KEYSTROKE MACROS:

		Ruler
		Capitalize all letters on current line

DATAFLEX
	To compile with Dataflex you must use the provided batch file
	DFLEX.BAT for your compile command line.  For example:
		DFLEX <FILE> <EXT>
	Make sure the CR/LF at eof is turned ON. You will find this
	toggle in the Edit Settings sub-menu of the Install menu.
	While you are in the Install menu, create a Filename Extension
	setup and compiler setup for Dataflex.

CLARION
	To compile with CLARION you must use the provided batch file
	CLARC.BAT for your compile command line.  For example:
		CLARC <FILE>
	(The CLARC.BAT file assumes a .CLA extension)

ALSYS ADA
	To compile with ALSYS ADA you must use the provided batch file
	ADACOMP.BAT for your compile command line.  For example:
		ADACOMP <FILE>
	(The ADACOMP.BAT file assumes a .ADA extension)


	If you use a BATCH file to compile, you will probably have to
	add <NR> to your command line (in Filename Extension Setup -
	Install-Filename extension-F3-Compiler/prog setup) where you
	specify the Batch file, to avoid double re-direction.

HISTORY LISTS
	We added a last-minute configuration option for history lists.
	If you add the following global integer to your STARTUP macro,
	you can set the maximum length of the history list:

		Set_Global_Int("@HISTORY_LENGTH",15);

	The value of 15 shown above is the default.  Any value greater
	than 0 is legal.

		     CONVERTING 5.0 MACROS TO 6.0

We have converted all of our macros to the new CMAC syntax.  If you
chose to do so, the macro SRCCONV will do most of the conversion for
you.  You MUST install SRCCONV from the Help / Languages / Keymaps /
Other section of Module Installation.

MEMAC is still supported, BUT we can not guarantee that it will
continue to be supported in future major releases.

NOTE:  The system function calls between MEMAC and CMAC are identical.


There are a few changes to the system function calls (from 5.0 to 6.0)
that may effect your macros:

        TOGGLE_VIDEO            No longer exists!!!!

        VIDEO_MODE              Returns an integer:
                                0 = 25 lines
                                1 = 30/33 lines
                                2 = 43/50 lines

                                255 = #of lines overridden with /X /Y
                                      switches.
	SET_VIDEO_MODE( mode )  New!!
				0 = 25 lines
				1 = 30/33 lines
				2 = 43/50 lines

				Should NOT be used, instead use the
				macro
					SETUP^TGLVID /M=n
				where "n" is the video mode to switch
				to!

	BLOCK_STAT is now a variable.

	PERSISTENT_BLOCKS	If your macro relies on a block
				remaining on while the cursor is moved,
				then you need to save the old status of
				PERSISTENT_BLOCKS, set it to TRUE, and
				then restore it when you are done.  See
				the docs for more info on
				PERSISTENT_BLOCKS.

MULTI-FILE SEARCH SWITCHES
	Multi-File search switches effect regular search switches.
	i.e., if you have regular expressions turned off by default,
	then you do a Multi-File search with expressions turned on, the
	normal search dialog box will show regular expressions as being
	on.  This is not actually a bug, as the change to the defaults
	is necessary in order for the "Repeat Previous Search" function
	to work in conjunction with Multi-File search.

<CtrlShft> AND <AltShft> KEY COMBINATIONS On some keyboards, not all
        keys may be able to be used with the <CtrlShft> and <AltShft>
        combinations.  This is due to differences in various
        manufacturers BIOS.  We will try to get all of the
        possibilities in as we find out about them.  The /KX switch
        will disable capturing INT 9.  This will disable all of the
        CtrlShft and AltShft keys, and the ShftGreyArrow keys.
        However, it may solve some compatibility issues.

<CtrlShft> AND <AltShft> MOUSE BUTTON COMBINATIONS
	<CtrlShft> and <AltShft> mouse button combinations are not
	currently supported.

OS/2
	It has been reported that when you run Multi-Edit on some
	configurations of OS/2, it may take as long as 25 seconds for
	it to load.  Of all the reported cases so far, the use of the
	/KN command line switch fixes the problem.

DIRECTORY LIST LIMITATION
	Directory lists in the File Manager and File Load/Save prompts
	are limited to 600 entries.  The reason for this is that in
	order to keep the display and sorting fast enough to be
	acceptable for most users, the memory block used for a
	directory list must be confined to one data segment, which
	happens to equate to approximately 600 entries.
