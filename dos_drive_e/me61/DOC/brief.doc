		       New Brief Emulation Macro

When using the Brief keymap:

	Block operations now unmark blocks when they are copied/moved
	to the hidden buffer or written to disk.

	Block paste operations now do not leave the pasted text marked.

	Tab now indents/undents blocks multiple times and does not end 
	the block.  Also when using a columnar block indenting/ 
	undenting of the block take take place at the left edge of the 
	block.

	The delete key will delete the currently marked block.

	One can now switch blocking modes (stream, columnar, line)
	without having to turn the block off first.

	Searching within a block has been improved and will also flip 
	the anchor point of the block to keep repeated searches 
	confined within the block.
